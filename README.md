# Sorting Machine Project

Welcome to the Sorting Machine Project repository! This project was developed as part of the RoboVerse event organized by the Robotics Club at EJUST. Our goal was to create an automated sorting machine using OpenCV and ROS technologies to categorize objects based on their size, color, and shape.

## Project Overview

The Sorting Machine is designed to automate the process of sorting objects. It uses a conveyor belt system to transport items and a revolving arm mechanism to sort them into designated categories. The project combines image processing, robotic control, and mechanical design to achieve efficient and accurate sorting.

## Key Features

- **OpenCV Integration**: Real-time object detection and categorization based on size, color, and shape.
- **ROS Integration**: Seamless robotic control and automation for the sorting process.
- **Custom Hardware Design**: Entire conveyor belt system and revolving arm mechanism designed and built from scratch.
- **Efficient Sorting**: High-speed and precise classification of various objects.

## Technologies Used

- **OpenCV**: For image processing and object detection.
- **ROS (Robot Operating System)**: For robotic control and automation.
- **Python**: Main programming language for integration and control.
- **Mechanical Components**: Conveyor belt and revolving arm mechanism designed and fabricated by the team.

## Getting Started

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ahmed-Ismail-elbrolosy/sorting-machine.git
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   cd sorting-machine
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the project**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

- Place objects on the conveyor belt.
- The system will automatically detect and categorize the objects based on their size, color, and shape.
- The revolving arm will sort the objects into the appropriate bins.
